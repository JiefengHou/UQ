          <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item well">
                  <h2>1.  Can anyone sign up to Unicab?</h2>
                  <p>Unicab is exclusively for students enrolled in any of our participating Universities. In order to sign up for our service you must have a university issued email address.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item well">
                  <h2>2.  Why should I use Unicab?</h2>
                  <p>Unicab is not only a cheap alternative to traditional commuting methods but is also a means for making friends and engaging with like-minded peers within your university. Unicab is both beneficial to drivers and passengers alike and overall serves to reduce daily transportation costs to and from university.</p>
                </li>    
                <li class="list-group-item well">
                  <h2>3.  Is Unicab safe?</h2>
                  <p>All drivers and passengers who sign up to our service must undergo a strict authentication process. Our system will conduct background checks on all drivers to ensure they hold a valid clean licence. All users are required to carry identification with them while using our service. All parties must produce proof identification at any stage of the journey upon request.</p>
                </li>    
                <li class="list-group-item well">
                  <h2>4.  Is Unicab free?</h2>
                  <p>Unicab is free to sign up to for all users. Unicab has no predetermined fares; instead payments are made on a contribution- style basis and are completely at the discretion of the users. Unicab will provide recommended fares calculated by means of estimated journey time and distance travelled.</p>
                </li>    
                <li class="list-group-item well">
                  <h2>5.  Is Unicab available in my university?</h2>
                  <p>Unicab currently only operates in conjunction with the University of Queensland. However, we hope by the end of 2015 to expand to Brisbane’s major universities including QUT and Griffith.</p>
                </li>    
                <li class="list-group-item well">
                  <h2>6.  Can I be both a driver and a passenger?</h2>
                  <p>Yes! Once you create an account with Unicab you can interchange between being a driver and passenger at any stage as your needs require. </p>
                </li>    
                <li class="list-group-item well">
                  <h2>7.  I am a driver; do I need to provide my own car?</h2>
                  <p>Yes, unfortunately Unicab does not supply vehicles for the use of our service. All potential drivers must provide their own road worthy vehicle suitable for the carriage of passengers.</p>
                </li> 
                <li class="list-group-item well">
                  <h2>8.  I had a bad experience; can I report my driver?</h2>
                  <p>Yes. Following each journey users will be encouraged to rate their experience online. Comments and ratings will be mandatorily displayed the user’s profile. Incidents may also be reported directly to the company via our customer service portal. Our customer service team will then take all necessary steps to follow up any reported incidents. </p>
                </li>  
                <li class="list-group-item well">
                  <h2>9.  I am a driver; will Unicab void my insurance?</h2>
                  <p>No. With Unicab you are essentially giving your peers a lift to and from university. Instead of having set fares we work on a contribution based payment system which will not void your insurance.</p>
                </li>  
                <li class="list-group-item well">
                  <h2>10. Can I smoke during my journey?</h2>
